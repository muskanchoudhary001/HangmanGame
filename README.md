# Hangman Game

Welcome to Hangman, a classic word-guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project challenges you to guess all the letters of a randomly generated word within a limited number of attempts. As you make incorrect guesses, a hangman illustration progressively appears on the gallows. Are you up for the challenge?

## Features

- **Random Word Generation**: A new word is generated every time you refresh the page, providing endless gameplay possibilities.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy playing Hangman on any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click or tap on letters to guess them. Keep track of your progress and try to avoid the hangman's noose!

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser or host the project on a local server.
2. Once the game loads, a random word will be generated, and the hangman illustration will appear.
